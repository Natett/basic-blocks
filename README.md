## How To Install/ Use/ Learn
This repo has three blocks:

 * "Call To Action" - A basic static block.
 * "Call To Action Editable" - A static block with editable options.
 * "Call To Action Editable Advanced" - A static block with editable options and even more controls and WordPress APIs.
 * "Post Title" - An example of block that replaces a shortcode.
 
 These blocks were made without JSX or any build tools first. Then they were converted to JSX, using webpack. The first commit in the conversion to JSX is [8b01eaffdea8222435d296dd85a3bfef74d5ccfd](https://github.com/caldera-learn/basic-blocks/commit/8b01eaffdea8222435d296dd85a3bfef74d5ccfd)
